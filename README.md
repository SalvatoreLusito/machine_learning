## Project Description:
The aim of the project is to explore different techniques, applying them to a classification
(MONKâ€™s problem [1]) and a regression (ML CUP) task. In order to do so, performances
of Artificial Neural Networks has been compared with that of other models like SVM,
Naive Bayes, Random Forest and SVR across various libraries provided by the ScikitLearn and Keras libraries.
